I'm a partner at Founder Centric, where I teach founders how to get traction quickly and help accelerators and universities design more responsive programmes. I've founded 5 startups, my early successes ironically funding my later failures. I started Leancamp, an event for founders and thought-leaders to dig into what really works. It connected Lean Startup to UX and Business Model Generation and now covers 14 cities and two continents.
 
I've directed projects for big companies like Nestle and JWT, and taught at top universities and accelerators - but I think a more impressive accomplishment was finally admitting failure on my last startup.
