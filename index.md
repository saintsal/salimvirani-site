I'm a partner at Founder Centric, where I teach founders how to get traction quickly and help accelerators and universities design more responsive programmes. I've founded 5 startups, my early successes ironically funding my later failures. I started Leancamp, an event for founders and thought-leaders to dig into what really works. It connected Lean Startup to UX and Business Model Generation and now covers 14 cities and two continents.
 
I've directed projects for big companies like Nestle and JWT, and taught at top universities and accelerators - but I think a more impressive accomplishment was finally admitting failure on my last startup. 

#Projects

## Decision Hacks
A handy book to keep around. It's a set of prompts that reframe tough decisions to make them faster. Think of it like your side-kick for course-correction. [Interested? Click here to learn more.](http://decisionhacks.co)

## Leancamp
A volunteer-only community that connects startup founders to other communities to trade practical notes on getting market traction.  Leancamp sparked the first connections between Lean Startup, business model innovation and User Experience Design. Started in London in 2010, Leancamp now runs from San Francisco, USA to Sofia, Bulgaria - and looks like we'll be in Asia soon too. Check it out at [leancamp.co](http://leancamp.co) or search for it on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23leancamp&src=typd) of [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=leancamp&s=int).

## Founder Centric
A training and education business that helps founders suck less. We generally work with startup accelerators and universities, and get founders to market traction through short, practical workshops.  Our approach is based on teaching principles through story-telling and exercises that actually move the startup forward. Learn more on [our site](http://foundercentric.com).

## Village Accelerator
As smartphones and the internet become accessible to the poorest communities in the world, can a version of the accelerator business model enable them?  I'm running a pilot with a Roma community in Bulgaria, and travelling to Africa, The Carribean and S.E. Asia to better understand local needs.

## Rapid Refresher
A tool to refresh yourself on long lists - stuff you know and just need a quick flash to keep top of mind.

Use it for Someday/Maybe reviews, a meeting wrap-up, and priming your mind with notes. I built it for reviewing Customer Development notes before discussions and decisions.

## CustDev Cards

An online card deck to trigger more creative ways of learning from customers in early-stage startups.

# Parked Due To Time Constraints

## Signally
A simple app for recording customer conversations, and spotting patterns between them for better decision making.  I got stuck on some onboarding problems related to Customer Development training, which constitute a strong signal that a public release is premature at the moment. You can sign up to the waiting list at [signal.ly](http://signal.ly).

## Option Cards
A light-weight business modelling technique that enables founders to balance between focus and opportunity.  It emphasises the dynamics that make or break business models. A few apps have been developed, but it works fine as a manual method using index cards. 

## Mentor Impact
A research project that aims at improving startup mentoring. I asked top-rated startup mentors about their approach, and shared it with other mentors in a set of workshops in London. I'd like to at least release this as an online workshop, but need to find a good-enough feedback mechanism so mentors can contribute their experiences to evolve the material. You can sign up for the release at [mentorimpact.co](http://mentorimpact.co).

# Past
## Hide Guides
While on holiday in S.E. Asia, I investigated the potential to disrupt TripAdvisor with a marketplace connecting travelers and local guides in advance.  I was able to oscillate between Customer Development conversations and business model prototypying, and invalidate a set of business models quickly by correlating to existing customer behaviour.

## BusinessModelsJS
A small library that generates business model canvases within a web page using SVG. I've used this to prototype a few business model tools, and have released it as [Open Source on Github](https://github.com/saintsal/businessmodeljs).

## Tweetable Text
A Wordpress plugin that allows individual phrases in blog posts to become instantly tweetable with a click. I released it as [Open Source on Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/tweetable-text/), and it has since been forked and advanced [here](https://github.com/yurivictor/tweetable-text).

#Tools

Here's a quick list of tools I've made that I find I share pretty often.  Feel free to ask me about anything on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/saintsal) or [email](/contact).

## Pitch Bingo
Help teams know where to focus for funding, by running informal pitches with real evaluators.  The evaluators then return the cards, highlighting the information missing in the pitch so the presenters can absorb the feedback, rather than keep selling.
